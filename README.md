# AirBnB clone Project
---
## Description

<P>This project is the first step towards building an AirBnB clone. The goal is to create a command interpreter that manages AirBnB objects, including a parent class (`BaseModel`), several classes for AirBnB objects(e.g., `User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`,â€¦),
and a simple file storage engine.</p>
