# AirBnB clone Project
---
## Description

This project is the first step towards building an AirBnB clone. The goal is to create a command interpreter that manages AirBnB objects, including a parent class (`BaseModel`), several classes for AirBnB objects(e.g., `User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`,â€¦),
and a simple file storage engine.

## Features

- Command interpreter for managing AirBnB objects
- Serialization and deserialization of objects to JSON
- Classes for User, State, City, Place, and more

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/KillerA-z1/AirBnB_clone.git
```

## Usage

To start the command interpreter, run the `console.py` file:

```bash
./console.py
```

In the console, you can create a new object, show an object, delete an object, and do many other operations.
